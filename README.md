# VideoNote

_Create timestamped notes based off video._

Ongoing project which started about 7 years ago when I was first lost in the land of code. There have been a few iterations/variations in both vanilla js, Angular 1 and incorporating Firebase. Since it's been a few years... lets make a slicker version in React. ;)

### `npm build`

And away we go! ðŸš€

# TODO

- [ ] click timestamp on todo input to disable timestamp add
- [ ] seek whilst there is a note changes timestamp
- [ ] selected note jumps to timestamp
- [ ] selected note click timestamp and seek to change the time
- [ ] full screen video with note input
- [ ] sidebar opens with all notes
- [ ] can have notes without timestamps
- [ ] as video plays relevant todo shows/highlighted whilst timestamp is met
- [ ] save todos to csv so it can be re-used for other purposes
- [ ] load back in csv? with video url too?
